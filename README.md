# About
This resource pack has modified two resource packs by Vanilla Tweaks (No Bowl Particles and Item Hold Fix) and has adjusted Eating Animation to ensure compatibility. Without this patch, the stew and soup eating animations won't play with the Vanilla Tweaks resource packs active.
# Notice
This resource pack **has** to be a priority above Fabric mods in the resource packs options menu. This resource pack has embedded the No Bowl Particles and Item Hold Fix resource packs by Vanilla Tweaks. However, if you have them also active separately, ensure this resource pack is a priority above them and Fabric mods.
